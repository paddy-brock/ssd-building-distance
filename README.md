Enhancing the Google Open Buildings layer for South Sudan for host community and refugee sampling for the UNHCR Forced Displacement Survey

To allow for stratified sampling of host community household by distance to nearest refugee camp, combine Google Open Buildings data with UNHCR settlement perimeter data.

Tag building objects by in/out perimeters.

Calculate distance for those outside to nearest perimeter (and tag which it is).

Add a tag for estimated building area to identify very large and small ones for priority visual testing.
